# re
re defines regular expression functions, it's intended to be a drop-in subset of python's re module for starlark: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

## Functions

#### `search(pattern, text, flags=0`
Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match,
and return a corresponding match object. Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern;
note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.

**parameters:**

| name | type | description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | `string` | regular expression pattern string |
| `text` | `string` | string to find within |
| `flags` | `int` | integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use |


#### `match(pattern, text, flags=0)`
If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern,
return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern;
note that this is different from a zero-length match.

`re.match()` will only match at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.
If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use `search()` instead

**parameters:**

| name | type | description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | `string` | regular expression pattern string |
| `text` | `string` | string to find within |
| `flags` | `int` | integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use |


#### `findall(pattern, text, flags=0)`
Returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result.

**parameters:**

| name | type | description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | `string` | regular expression pattern string |
| `text` | `string` | string to find within |
| `flags` | `int` | integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use |


#### `split(pattern, text, maxsplit=0, flags=0)`
Split text by the occurrences of pattern. If capturing parentheses are used in pattern, then the text of all groups in the pattern are also returned as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits occur, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element of the list.

**parameters:**

| name | type | description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | `string` | regular expression pattern string |
| `text` | `string` | input string to split |
| `maxsplit` | `int` | maximum number of splits to make. default 0 splits all matches |
| `flags` | `int` | integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use |


#### `sub(pattern, repl, text, count=0, flags=0)`
Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern in string by the replacement repl. If the pattern isnâ€™t found, string is returned unchanged. repl can be a string or a function; if it is a string, any backslash escapes in it are processed. That is, \n is converted to a single newline character, \r is converted to a carriage return, and so forth.

**parameters:**

| name | type | description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | `string` | regular expression pattern string |
| `repl` | `string` | string to replace matches with |
| `text` | `string` | input string to replace |
| `count` | `int` | number of replacements to make, default 0 means replace all matches |
| `flags` | `int` | integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use |


#### `compile(pattern, flags=0)`
Compile a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object, which
can be used for matching using its match(), search() and other methods. This can be helpful for patterns that are used repeatedly.

**parameters:**

| name | type | description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | `string` | regular expression pattern string |
| `flags` | `int` | integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use |

**usage**

The compiled expression then supports the following methods, which are similar to those described above except that they pattern no longer needs to be specified:

- `search(text, flags=0)`
- `match(text, flags=0)`
- `split(text, flags=0)`
- `findall(text, flags=0)`
- `sub(text, repl, flags=0)`
